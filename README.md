## About

Hi C coders!, Check out *The Office quiz game*, a quick and fun project I created while learning and practicing C programming. 
This text-based game is centered around my favorite sitcom 'The Office', and challenges players to navigate through different scenarios 
inspired by the show's characters and plot. Follow the instructions and choose your actions carefully to advance and earn points. Enjoy the 
game and feel free to contribute to its development!"
